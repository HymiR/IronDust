Some words about the OBJ loader from the OpenGL Tutorial:

This one is a real asshole. Like the original author mentioned it can't do shit!
Do REALLY search for a better one!

Some things to consider about exporting .obj files if we use this loader:

* Create fucking UV coordinates or it won't work, in Blender:
 - When you have a model: switch to Edit Mode
 - Mesh -> UV Unwrap -> Unwrap

* Exporting Options:

 File -> Export -> Wavefront (.obj)

 - Selection only
 - Write Normals
 - Include UVs (don't fuck with this one)
 - Triangulate Faces (if you don't use this, Blender will export Quads and your model will look like swiss cheese)
